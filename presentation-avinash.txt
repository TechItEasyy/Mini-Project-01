*what is [D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[C whwhat is an object-oriented programming language?
-> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer
programming model that organizes software design
around data, or objects, rather than functions and
logic.
Eg. C++,java etc

* Difference between class and object?
-> Class:: Classes are user-defined data types that
act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes
and methods.
*When classes create. it does not take
memory.
*Class is logical entity.
*When class creates use class keyword.
Object::Object is an instance of a class. All data
members and member functions of the class can be
accessed with the help of objects.
*Object is instance of class and it take
memory when class is instantiated (i.e. an object is
created).
*Object is physical entity.
*Object is created by new keyword.

* What are OOPS concepts?
-> a. Inheritance
Ans:Inheritance is an important pillar of
OOP(Object-Oriented Programming). It is the mechanism
in java by which one class is allowed to inherit the
features(fields and methods) of another class.
● Super Class: The class whose features are inherited is
known as a superclass(or a base class or a parent class).
● Sub Class: The class that inherits the other class is known
as a subclass(or a derived class, extended class, or child
class). The subclass can add its own fields and methods in
addition to the superclass fields and methods.
The keyword used for inheritance is extends.
Syntax :
class derived-class extends base-class
{
//methods and fields
}
b. Encapsulation
Ans: Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of
data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds
together code and the data it manipulates. Another way
to think about encapsulation is, that it is a protective
shield that prevents the data from being accessed by
the code outside this shield.
As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from
other classes using the data hiding concept which is
achieved by making the members or methods of a class
private, and the class is exposed to the end-user or the
world without providing any details behind
implementation using the abstraction concept, so it is
also known as a combination of data-hiding and
abstraction.
c. Polymorphism
Ans: polymorphism allows you to define one interface
and have multiple implementations. The word “poly”
means many and “morphs” means forms, So it means
many forms.
Types of polymorphism
In Java polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:
● Compile-time Polymorphism (method overloading)
● Runtime Polymorphism (method overriding)
d. Abstraction
Ans: Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which
only the essential details are displayed to the user. The
trivial or the non-essential units are not displayed to
the user.
In java, abstraction is achieved by interfaces and
abstract classes. We can achieve 100% abstraction using
interfaces.
e. Interface
Ans:An Interface in Java programming language is
defined as an abstract type used to specify the behavior
of a class. An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class.
A Java interface contains static constants and abstract
methods.
The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve
abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the
Java interface, not the method body. It is used to
achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
Syntax:
interface {
// declare constant fields
// declare methods that abstract
// by defaul
