* What is DDL, DML,DQL,TCL,DCL?
-> 
    Data Definition Language (DDL)
    DDL queries are made up of SQL commands that can be used to define the structure of the database and modify it.

        CREATE Creates databases, tables, schema, etc.
        DROP: Drops tables and other database objects
        DROP COLUMN: Drops a column from any table structure
        ALTER: Alters the definition of database objects
        TRUNCATE: Removes tables, views, procedures, and other database objects
        ADD COLUMN: Adds any column to the table schema
    Data Manipulation Language (DML)
    These SQL queries are used to manipulate data in a database.

        SELECT INTO: Selects data from one table and inserts it into another
        INSERT: Inserts data or records into a table
        UPDATE: Updates the value of any record in the database
        DELETE: Deletes records from a table
    Data Control Language (DCL)
    These SQL queries manage the access rights and permission control of the database.

        GRANT: Grants access rights to database objects
        REVOKE: Withdraws permission from database objects
    Transaction Control Language (TCL)
    TCL is a set of commands that essentially manages the transactions in a database and the changes made by the DML statements. TCL allows statements to be grouped together into logical transactions. 

        COMMIT: Commits an irreversible transaction, i.e., the previous image of the database prior to the transaction cannot be retrieved
        ROLLBACK: Reverts the steps in a transaction in case of an error
        SAVEPOINT: Sets a savepoint in the transaction to which rollback can be executed
        SET TRANSACTION: Sets the characteristics of the transaction

* DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DELETE AND TRUNCATE?
-> 
    DELETE: This query is used to delete or remove one or more existing tables.
    TRUNCATE: This statement deletes all the data from inside a table.

What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands

The difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands are as follows:

    TRUNCATE is a DDL command, and DELETE is a DML command.
    With TRUNCATE, we cannot really execute and trigger, while with DELETE, we can accomplish a trigger.
    If a table is referenced by foreign key constraints, then TRUNCATE will not work. So, if we have a foreign key, then we have to use the DELETE command.

The syntax for the DELETE command:

DELETE FROM table_name
[WHERE condition];

Example:

select * from stu

Output:
output 5

delete from stu where s_name=â€™Bobâ€™

Output:

output 6

The syntax for the TRUNCATE command:

TRUNCATE TABLE
Table_name;

Example:

select * from stu1

Output:

output 7

truncate table stu1

Output:

output 8

This deletes all the records from a table

* DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DELETE AND DROP?
-> DELETE IS DML AND DROP IS DDL
   DELETE COMMAND DELETE ONE OR ALL ROWS OF TABLE BUT TABLE STRUCTURE EXIST BUT DROP DELETED FULL TABLE WITH ITS STRUCTURE

* DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TABLE AND FIELD?
-> TABLE IS COLLECTION OF FIELD AND ROWS BUT FIELD IS A PART OF TABLE I.E IT IS A COLOUMN OF TABLE.

*DIFFERENCE BETWEEN tABLE AND VIEW?
-> Views are virtual tables used to limit the tables that we want to display. Views are nothing but the result of an SQL statement that has a name associated with it. Since views are not physically present, they take less space to store.BUT TABLE IS PHYSICAL OR REAL EXISTANCE.

* WHAT IS ALIAS?
->SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.
